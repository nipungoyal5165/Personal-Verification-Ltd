<span style="font-size:50px;">CV fraud and lying about past accomplishments is increasing, so it’s more important than ever to undertake background checks of job applicants.<br><br>
    Your best defence against employing someone who has lied on their application, is to have PVL crosscheck and verify their background.<br><br>

<p style="font-size: 50px;"><b>- CEO accused of CV fraud</b><br>
    25 February 2014<br><br>
    A report by "The New Zealand Herald” today has claimed that Michael Vukcevic, CEO of Auckland intellectual property law firm Baldwins, resigned from his position three months ago after it was discovered he had falsely claimed to have a law degree from Victoria University.<br>
    Forty-three year old Vukcevic’s CV, submitted to a recruitment company, claimed he had been awarded a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Law degree by Victoria University of Wellington. However, the University told the newspaper Vukcevic had only been awarded a BA, majoring in Economic History, in December 1993.<br>
    When Vukcevic resigned as CEO, Baldwins released a press statement stating he had “stepped down for personal reasons”.<br>
    Prior to his appointment, Vukcevic was CEO of Pharmaceutical Solutions Ltd for 20 months, an Executive Director at Ernest & Young for almost five years, and a Sales Manager at Fonterra for three years. He was also on the board of Transparency International New Zealand, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to promoting transparency, accountability and integrity in Government and civil society. He was also on the Board of the Foundation for Social Responsibility. And three months after leaving Baldwins, Vukcevic remains Chairman of the New Zealand-Middle East Business Council.<br>
    It is unwise to accept a CV without verifying its content. If a job applicant claims to have a degree it is essential to confirm its authenticity. The question needs to be asked when did Vukcevic first claim to have a law degree, and how many of these companies and organisations hired or appointed him without verifying his background?<br><br>
    PVL Update (26 February): In a statement released to the media, Vukcevic admitted he did not have a law degree.<br><br>

<p style="font-size: 50px;"><b>- Woman with previous conviction for theft steals $4.5 million</b><br>
    25 July 2014<br><br>
    A woman with prior convictions for workplace theft was today sentenced to 4½ years imprisonment for stealing almost $4.5 million from her latest employer, freight company Mainfreight.<br><br>
    Fijian-born, Sushila Devi Mosese, a 51 year-old credit controller, stole the money from Mainfreight over a seven year period.<br><br>
    Her duties included collecting outstanding invoices owed to the company, but instead of depositing the money into Mainfreight’s bank account, she instead deposited it into a bank account that she had created, with a name similar to that of Mainfreight’s.<br><br>
    Almost 500 cheques were deposited into the account she controlled, from which she withdrew cash - up to $850,000 in one year.<br>
    The Court heard today that the offending had had flow-on effects for the company's relationships with its customers,<br>
    The company’s reputational and financial losses might have been avoided if adequate pre employment background screening of Mosese had been undertaken, which could have identified her previous conviction for employee theft.<br><br>
    Meanwhile, Mosese' s brother, Vincent Thakur Singh, has pleaded guilty in California to a $23 million fraud case investigated by the FBI. He awaits sentencing.<br><br>

<p style="font-size: 50px;"><b>- Convicted fraudster steals from another employer</b><br>
    27 September 2013<br><br>
    Alexandra Holland was today sentenced to three years and four months imprisonment in the Auckland District Court for stealing $453,643 from her employer, Carter Bloodstock.<br><br>
    The 39 year-olds offending occurred over a two year period, from 2010 to 2012, when Holland worked as Secretary for the business owners.<br><br>
    In a victim impact statement read to the Court, the company owner said "one of the worst parts of this whole experience is that it makes me no longer trust anyone whom I employ".<br><br>
    And later, the other company owner in a statement to the media said “I have been totally devastated. I still find it impossible to believe that I was lied to and deceived day after day for several years. I feel I can't trust anyone again. I have had many sleepless nights since her enormous breach of trust. It never occurred to me that she would forge my signature”.<br><br>
    At PVL our advice is that employers should trust their staff, but they should also verify their backgrounds before hiring them, or get a professional screening provider to do it for them. Had Carter Bloodstock taken this precaution they would have learnt that Holland was already a convicted thief, having stolen $67,875 in 2005 from her previous employer, Coca-Cola Amatil.<br><br>
    If Carter Bloodstock had known of Holland’s recent previous employee fraud conviction we doubt they would have hired her, and they would have saved themselves the financial and emotional damage that Holland’s offending had on them.<br><br>
    For often less than an employee’s first day’s salary, we can reduce the risk that you are about to hire an unsuitable job applicant. Contact us for further information.<br><br>
