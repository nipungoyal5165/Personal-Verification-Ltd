<span style="font-size:50px;">Failing to undertake background screening before hiring someone can have devastating financial and reputational effects on a company.<br><br>

Employers wouldn't dream of committing company funds to an expensive purchase like a computer network or vehicle fleet without undertaking due diligence, but many employers think nothing of hiring staff (always a company's biggest expense and risk), based purely on instinct.<br><br>
    
The following stories all concern New Zealand employers who failed to undertake or request adequate background screening and consequently unknowingly hired convicted criminals or CV liars who later stole from them or ruined their organisations' reputation.<br><br><br><br>

<p style="font-size: 50px;"><b>- Manager steals once again - previously jailed for stealing $1.1 million</b><br>
    17 October 2016<br><br>
    Richard Gregory Beven, the 41 year-old Operations Manager of the Wanaka Lakes Health Centre was today sentenced for stealing $730,517 from his employer during the period 2011 to 2015.<br><br>
    Police said he spent the funds on a lavish lifestyle of international and national travel, meals and liquor, and a 40th birthday party for himself at a local Queenstown golf course that cost $23,628.<br><br>
    If the medical practice had invested as little as $100 in having a background screening company undertake probity enquires before hiring Bevan, it would have learnt that he had been sentenced to 3½ years in prison for defrauding a previous employer of $1.1 million, in 2003. The Medical Practice has spent more than $40,000 trying to work out just how much Bevan had stolen from them<br><br>
    ​Bevan was sentenced to three years and seven months imprisonment. No order for reparation was made.<br><br>

<p style="font-size: 50px;"><b>- Woman with previous conviction for theft steals $4.5 million</b><br>
    25 July 2014<br><br>
    A woman with prior convictions for workplace theft was today sentenced to 4½ years imprisonment for stealing almost $4.5 million from her latest employer, freight company Mainfreight.<br><br>
    Fijian-born, Sushila Devi Mosese, a 51 year-old credit controller, stole the money from Mainfreight over a seven year period.<br><br>
    Her duties included collecting outstanding invoices owed to the company, but instead of depositing the money into Mainfreight’s bank account, she instead deposited it into a bank account that she had created, with a name similar to that of Mainfreight’s.<br><br>
    Almost 500 cheques were deposited into the account she controlled, from which she withdrew cash - up to $850,000 in one year.<br>
    The Court heard today that the offending had had flow-on effects for the company's relationships with its customers,<br>
    The company’s reputational and financial losses might have been avoided if adequate pre employment background screening of Mosese had been undertaken, which could have identified her previous conviction for employee theft.<br><br>
    Meanwhile, Mosese' s brother, Vincent Thakur Singh, has pleaded guilty in California to a $23 million fraud case investigated by the FBI. He awaits sentencing.<br><br>

<p style="font-size: 50px;"><b>- Convicted fraudster steals from another employer</b><br>
    27 September 2013<br><br>
    Alexandra Holland was today sentenced to three years and four months imprisonment in the Auckland District Court for stealing $453,643 from her employer, Carter Bloodstock.<br><br>
    The 39 year-olds offending occurred over a two year period, from 2010 to 2012, when Holland worked as Secretary for the business owners.<br><br>
    In a victim impact statement read to the Court, the company owner said "one of the worst parts of this whole experience is that it makes me no longer trust anyone whom I employ".<br><br>
    And later, the other company owner in a statement to the media said “I have been totally devastated. I still find it impossible to believe that I was lied to and deceived day after day for several years. I feel I can't trust anyone again. I have had many sleepless nights since her enormous breach of trust. It never occurred to me that she would forge my signature”.<br><br>
    At PVL our advice is that employers should trust their staff, but they should also verify their backgrounds before hiring them, or get a professional screening provider to do it for them. Had Carter Bloodstock taken this precaution they would have learnt that Holland was already a convicted thief, having stolen $67,875 in 2005 from her previous employer, Coca-Cola Amatil.<br><br>
    If Carter Bloodstock had known of Holland’s recent previous employee fraud conviction we doubt they would have hired her, and they would have saved themselves the financial and emotional damage that Holland’s offending had on them.<br><br>
    For often less than an employee’s first day’s salary, we can reduce the risk that you are about to hire an unsuitable job applicant. Contact us for further information.<br><br>
