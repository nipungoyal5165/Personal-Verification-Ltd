<span style="font-size:50px;"><span style="font-size: 50px;"><b>Personal Verification</b></span>  was established 16 years ago, in October 2006.  Our focus is supporting businesses and organisations to make informed decisions about who you employ. When it comes to verifying the integrity of your applicants for appointment, you are never alone.

<img style="top: 5px; width: 100%;" src="Craig Gubbins.png"><br>
I was born in Wellington and graduated in 1979 from Victoria University of Wellington with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology and Education. In 1980 I joined the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (SIS) as an Intelligence Officer.  I remained employed by the SIS for 26 years before retiring in 2006.  During this period my career involved the widest range of intelligence work and I represented and spoke on behalf of the New Zealand Government both at home and abroad.<br><br>
In the mid 1990â€™s I established the New Zealand Immigration Service's Intelligence Unit.  Its task then, as it is now, is to monitor, analyse, report and advise on illegal immigration practices and abuses of New Zealand's immigration policies.<br><br>
I later managed the New Zealand Government's Security Vetting programme, being responsible for the development of Government vetting policies and procedures.  My staff undertook more than 5,000 security vettings annually and it was my responsibility to determine and assess the trustworthiness and reliability of every CEO appointed by the Government to head all its departments and agencies.<br><br>
I offer a full polygraph examination service in New Zealand. I attended the Missouri Law Enforcement Academy, am a graduate of the United States National Polygraph Academy, a member of the American Polygraph Association, and the Missouri Polygraph Association.<br><br>
I am the only US-trained Polygraph Examiner in New Zealand. I am available to travel throughout the country to undertake confidential polygraph examinations on all issues, including marital, fidelity, family sexual abuse allegations, pre-employment, criminal, legal, civil litigation, employment disputes and fraud allegations. My entire profesional working life (43 years) has involved establishing the truth.<br>
I have completed additional professional development and training for administering polygraph examinations to convicted sex offenders and I am certified by the United States National Polygraph Academy to undertake post-conviction sex offender testing (PCSOT).<br>
I am a certified practicing Scientific Content Analysis (SCAN) analyst, having completed training in Canberra, and advanced instruction at the Headquarters of the Laboratory for Scientific Interrogation, in Phoenix, Arizona. I am retained by the New Zealand Government to undertake the forensic analysis of written and spoken statements for evidence of deception.<br>

<img style="top: 5px; width: 100%;" src="Genevieve Wardrop.png"><br>
I was born in South Africa and as a young child, emigrated to New Zealand with my parents and grew up in Rotorua.  I have a BA in History as well as a degree in Law from the University of Auckland.<br><br>
My working life has been spent in finance and administration, including the Development Finance Corporation, the Auckland High Court Law Library and PricewaterhouseCoopers, before establishing PVL.<br><br>
I have a particular interest in equity and ethics and their professional application in the business environment and believe PVL is a vehicle for rewarding honesty and integrity in candidates, and for encouraging ethical business practices.<br>
Craig and I have been partners in life, and business, for 24 years.<br>
